# 1. Getting Started

## Summary

- The American National Standards Institute established the standard of the C programming language.
- Other programming languages, such as C++ and C#, are derieved in part from the C language.
- The C language has a number of standard libraries containing tried and tested functions that can be used in any program.
- C libraries are contained in header files whose names have a **.h** extension.
- C programs are created as plain text files whose names have a **.c** extension.
- The popular GNU C Compiler (GCC) is included in the Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW) package.
- Adding the compiler's host directory to the system path conveniently allows the compiler to be run from any directory.
- Programs have one or more functions containing statements to be executed whenever the function is called.
- Every C program must have `main()` function.
- A function declaration begins by specifying the data type of the value to be returned after the function has been executed.
- The statements to be executed are contained withing `{}` braces and each statement must end with a `;` semi-colon terminator.
- Preprocessor instructions are implemented in the first stage of program compilation and will typically substitute library code.
- The GNU C Compiler is run with the `gcc` command and may include a `-o` option to name the executable output file.
- Temporary files created during the compilation process can be retained using the -save-temps compiler command options.
