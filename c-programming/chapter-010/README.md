## Notes
- The `fputc()` function can be used to write to a filestream one character at a time - typically by looping through a `char` array. Its companion `fgetc()` can be used to read from a filestream one character at a time.
- The `fputs()` function can be used to write to a filestream one line at a time, and its companion `fgets()` can be used to read from a filestream one line at a time.
- The `fread()` function can be used to read an entire filestream and its partner `fwrite()` can write an entire filestream.
- The `fscanf()` function and the `fprintf()` functions can be used to read and write filestreams with strings and numbers.
