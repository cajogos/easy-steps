# C Programming
You can get the book over on Amazon ([C Programming in Easy Steps on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2bOTEDM)).

## Notes
### Compiling using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Run the following command:

```bash
gcc file.c -o file.exe
```

To keep the assembly files use:

```bash
gcc file.c -save-temps -o file.exe
```

### Running Compiled File

To run the compiled file using Cygwin's terminal you must use Linux's `./`.

```bash
./file.exe
```
