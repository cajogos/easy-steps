# 2. Performing Operations

This chapter introduces the C++ operators and demonstrates the operations they can perform.

## Summary

- Arithmetical operators can form expressions with two operands for addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, or modulus `%`.
- Increment `++` and decrement `--` operators modify a single operand by a value of one.
- The assignment `=` operator can be combined with an arithmetical operator to perform an arithmetical calculation then assign its result.
- Comparison operators can form expressions comparing two operands for equality `==`, inequality `!=`, greater `>`, lesser `<`, greater or equal `>=`, and lesser or equal `<=` values.
- Logical `&&` and `||` operators form expressions evaluating two operands to return a **boolean** value of `true` or `false`.
- The logical `!` operator returns the inverse **boolean** value of a single operand.
- A ternary `?:` operator evaluates a given **boolean** expression then returns one of two operands depending on its result.
- The `sizeof` operator returns the memory byte size of a variable.
- An `int` variable may be qualified as a `short` type for smaller numbers or as a `long` type for large numbers.
- When an `int` variable will only store positive numbers it may be qualified as `unsigned` to extend its numeric range.
- It is important to explicitly set operator precedence in complex expressions by adding parentheses `()`.
- Data stored in a variable can be forced into a variable of a different data type by the casting process.
- **C++** supports traditional **C**-style casts and the newer form of casts that use the `static_cast` keyword.
