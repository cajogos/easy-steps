# 1. Getting Started

Welcome to the exciting world of C++ programming. This chapter demonstrates how to create a simple C++ program and how to store data within a program.

## Summary

- **C++** is an object-oriented programming language that is an extension of the procedural **C** programming language.
- The **GNU C++** compiler is available for Windows and Linux.
- Preprocessor directives are used to make functions within the standard **C++** libraries available to a program.
- Each **C++** program must contain one main method as the entry point to the program.
- Statements define the actions that the program will execute.
- It is recommended that program code should be widely commented to make its purpose clear.
- The `c++` command calls the compiler and its `-o` option allows the command to specify the name of the generated executable.
- A variable declaration specifies a data type and a chosen names by which the value within that variable can be referenced.
- The `cout` function, which is part of the **C++** `iostream` library, writes content to the standard output console.
- An array is a fixed variable that stores multiple items of data in element, which are numbered starting at zero.
- The special `\0` character can be assigned to the final statement of a `char` array to allow it to be treated as a single text string.
- A vector variable stores multiple items of data in elements and can be dynamically resized.
- The value stored in an array or vector element can be referenced using that variable's name and its index number.
- Variable values that are never changed by the program should be stored in a constant.
- A constant list can be automatically numbered by the `enum` keyword and given a type by the `typdef` keyword.
