# 2. Performing Operations

This chapter introduces the Python operators and demonstrates the operations they can perform.

## Summary

- Arithmetical operators can form expressions with two operands for addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, floor division `//`, modulus `%` or exponent `**`.
- The assignment `=` operator can be combined with an arithmetical operator to perform an arithmetical calculation then assign its result.
- Comparison operators can form expressions comparing two operands for equality `==`, inequality `!=`, greater `>`, lesser `<`, greater or equal `>=`, and lesser or equal `<=` values.
- Logical `and` and `or` operators form expressions evaluating two operands to return a **Boolean** value of `True` or `False`.
- The logical `not` operator returns the inverse **Boolean** value of a single operand.
- A conditional **if-else** expression evaluates a given expression for a **Boolean** `True` or `False` value then returns one of two operands depending on its result.
- Expressions containing multiple operators will execute their operations in accordance with the default precedence rules unless explicitly determined by the addition of parentheses `()`.
- The data type of a variable value can be converted to a different data type by the built-in Python functions `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` to return a new converted object.
- Python's built-in `type()` function determines to which data type class a specified variable belongs.
- Bitwise operators **OR** `|`, **AND** `&`, **NOT** `~`, and **XOR** `^` each return a value after comparison of the values within two bits, whereas the Shift left `<<` and Shift right `>>` operators move the bit values a specified number of bits in their direction.
