# 1. Getting Started

Welcome to the exciting world of Python programming language. This chapter demonstrates how to install Python and create your first program.

## Summary

- Python is a high-level programming language that is processed by the Python interpreter to produce results.
- Python uses indentation to group statements into code blocks, where other languages use keywords or punctuation.
- Python 2.7 is the final version of the 2.x branch of development but the 3.x branch has the latest improvements.
- Windows users can install Python with an MSI installer and Linux users can install Python with their package manager.
- The Python interpreter has an interactive mode where you can test snippets of code and is useful for debugging code.
- A Python program is simply a text file created with a plain text editor and saved with a ".py" file extension.
- The Python `print()` function outputs the string specified within its parentheses.
- String values must be enclosed between quote marks.
- Where multiple versions of Python are installed on the same system it is important to explicitly call the desired interpreter.
- A Python variable is a named container whose stored value can be referenced via that variable's name.
- A Python variable can contain any data type but must be given an initial value when it is declared.
- The Python `input()` function outputs the string specified whitin its parentheses then waits to read a line of input.
- Syntax errors due to incorrect code are recognized by the interpreter before execution of the program.
- Runtime errors due to exceptions are recognized by the interpreter during execution of the program.
- Semantic errors due to unexpected performance are not recognized by the interpreter.
