# 3. Making Statements

This chapter demonstrates how statements can evaluate expressions to determine the direction in which a Python program proceeds.

## Summary

- In Python, multiple assignments can be used to initialize several variables in a single statement.
- A Python list is a variable that can store multiple items of data in sequentially-numbered elements that start at zero.
- Data stored in a list element can be referenced using the list name followed by an index number in `[]` square brackets.
- The `len()` function returns the length of a specified list.
- A Python tuple is an immutable list whose values can be assigned to individual variables by "sequence unpacking".
- Data stored in a tuple element can be referenced using the tuple name followed by an index number in `[]` square brackets.
- A Python set is an ordered collection of unique elements whose values can be compared and manipulated by its methods.
- Data stored in a set cannot be referenced by index number.
- A Python dictionary is a list of **key:value** pairs of data in which each key must be unique.
- Data stored in a dictionary element can be referenced using the dictionary name followed by its key in `[]` square brackets.
- The Python `if` keyword performs a conditional test on an expression for a **Boolean** value of `True` or `False`.
- Conditional branching provides alternatives to an `if` test with the `else` and `elif` keywords.
- A `while` loop repeats until a test expression returns `False`.
- A `for in` loop iterates over each item in a specified list or **string**.
- The `range()` function generates a numerical sequence that can be used to specify the length of a `for in` loop.
- The `break` and `continue` keywords interrupt loop iterations.
